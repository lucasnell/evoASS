\section*{Results}



For both 2 and 3 traits:

Coexistence occurs when $d \ge 0$

\subsection*{Patterns of outcomes}

For 2 traits...

\begin{enumerate}
    \item when $\eta < 0$, two alternative stable states
    \item when $\eta = 0$, neutrally stable ring
    \item when $\eta > 0$, alternative stable states (perpendicular from when $\eta < 0$)
\end{enumerate}

unstable state when all traits are zero

saddle node when $\eta \ne 0$:
when starting value is exactly on line perpendicular to
the line formed by the alternative stable states, it'll go to the
two unstable states that are of the opposite scenario.
By scenario I mean that when stable states are at $V_1 = V_2$,
points on the saddle node go to the two points where $V_1 = -V_2$.
The inverse is also true.


For 3 traits...

\begin{enumerate}
    \item when $\eta < 0$, two alternative stable states
    \item when $\eta = 0$, neutrally stable "shell"
    \item when $\eta > 0$, neutrally stable ring
\end{enumerate}

I haven't explored this in detail, except that there is also
an unstable state when all traits are zero.
