Negative frequency-dependent selection (when rare phenotypes have the highest fitness)
is a form of balancing selection, acting to maintain genetic diversity.

LEFT OFF: I'm not sure about whether I can do this without using some type of
individual-based simulations.
And if I use individual-based simulations, then the first equation below doesn't work.

For a given value of $\nu$, fitness is a measure of its rarity:

$$
\begin{align}
F(\nu_i) = 1 + r_0 ~ \exp \left( { - \frac{\nu_i - \bar{\nu}}{2 V} } \right)
\end{align}
$$
where $V$ is the additive genetic variance in $\nu$.




From Northfield & Ives (2013; doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001685):

$$
\begin{align}
\nu_{t+1} &= \nu_t + \frac{V}{F} \frac{\partial F}{\partial \nu} \\
\end{align}
$$
