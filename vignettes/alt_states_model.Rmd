## Note on notation

Below, $*$ is vector multiplication
and
${}^T$ represents transpose.


## Model


Fitness for clone $i$ ($i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$) at time $t$ ($F_{it}$) is as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
    F_{i} &= \exp \left\{ r(V_i) - \alpha_{ii}(V_i) N_i - \sum_{j \ne i}^{n}{
        \alpha_{ij}(V_i, V_j) N_j}  \right\}\\
    r(V_i) &= r_0 - f ~ V_i * C * V_i^T \\
    \alpha_{ii}(V_i) &= g ~\exp \left\{- V_i * V_i^T \right\} \\
    \alpha_{ij}(V_i, V_j) &= g ~\exp \left\{- V_i * V_i^T - d ~ V_j * V_j^T \right\} \\
    C &=
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1       & \eta  \\
            \eta    & 1     \\
        \end{pmatrix} \\
\end{align}
$$

where
$V$ is an $n \times q$ matrix of trait values for all $n$ clones,
$V_i$ is a $1 \times q$ vector referring to the $i$th row in $V$,
$N$ is a $1 \times n$ vector of population abundances for all lines,
$r_0$ is the baseline growth rate,
$f$ is the cost of the trait on the growth rate,
$g$ is the benefit of the trait on density dependence,
$d$ changes how the focal line is affected by other lines' trait values,
and
$\eta$ is the non-additive effects of traits on $r$.



# Adaptive dynamics

From Tobin and Tony's paper:

> The model is initiated with single resource and consumer clones, and with 
> probability 0.01 each iteration, a clone gives rise to a daughter clone by
> selecting trait values from normal distributions with means given by the
> mother's trait values and standard deviation $\sigma$. The density of each clone is
> given by equations (1) or (2), and clones that drop below a density of 0.0001
> are assumed to go extinct.

I did the same thing but started with one competitor and used the equations above
for densities.
